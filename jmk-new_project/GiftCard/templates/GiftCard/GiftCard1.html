<p>For your understanding, slow fashion is an approach to making clothes to ensure they are worn as many times as possible to reduce waste, this is achieved through more durable fabrics and designs that last more than one fashion season.</p>

<p>Retailer A ranks 5/5 overall and in all areas. They’re a living wage employer and their production methods are of a higher ethical standard than the industry initiatives for employees, animals and the environment. Also, their clothes design and durability mean they are the best example of slow fashion.</p>
